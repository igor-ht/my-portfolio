Introducing "My Portfolio", a captivating personal portfolio web app built with **TypeScript**, **React.js**, **Next.js App Router**, **Prisma ORM**, and **SCSS**.

## Tech Stack

**Next.js** is a framework that works on top of **React.js** and offers _SSG_ *(Static Site Generation)* - which contributes to _SEO_ *(Search Engine Optimization)*, performance, and _UX_ *(User Experience)* -, and many other tools that optimize the project's development. Next.js also possibilities an easy way of dealing with *Static Rendering Data*, and together with **Prisma ORM**, it's possible to access the Database (in our case, hosted in **Supabase**) and retrieve data at build time.
This approach also creates a flexible and clean way to manipulate the data we want to display since it's not hardcoded, making the project more scalable and clean.\
For styling, I worked with **SCSS** and a *"7-1"* personalized architecture that consists of only three folders: *_base, _abstracts, and _components*, which is called by myself _'ABC' Architecture_. (This pattern might have different names but refers to the same thing: a _7-1ish SCSS architecture for smaller projects_.)

## Development Goals

- Create a responsible, visually appealing design and user-friendly SPA.
- Utilize Next.js for SSG, static-data rendering, optimized performance, and SEO capabilities.
- Use Prisma together with Supabase (SaS) for Database hosting and interaction.
- Stay up-to-date with modern web technologies and best practices.
